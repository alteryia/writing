# recluse

a recluse's haiku collection

## curtains

```
curtains drawn tightly
sunlight dare not cross the line
shadows feel safer

physically shielded
a refuge from piercing light
soft walls guard my fears

i dream of outside
yet fear its unforgiving
warmth upon my face
```

## echoes

```
shouts fill empty halls
your words echo in my head
i can't drown them out

conversations fade
words i might say stay silent
would you even hear?

then you say that i
can't speak because you refuse
to "allow" me to?
```

## freedom

```
isolated here
a world of my own design
freedom feels distant

am i truly free
if my freedom means hiding
from all that exists?
```

## invisible

```
i exist unseen
a shadow in your presence
am i even here?

value in my soul
not just what i can provide
see me as i am
```

## expectations

```
my existence has
no value unless it meets
your expectations?
```

## silence

```
with the loud silence
filling every empty space
can i bear its weight?
```

## judgment

```
every glance a blade
each word cuts with precision
why do I still care?

their gaze pierces through
even if they cannot see
the weight that remains
```

## success

```
why must i adhere
to your definition of
a "successful" life?

why must "success" be
determined by my income
and not happiness?
```

## time

```
stagnant existence
clocks tick, but nothing changes
time mocks my stillness
```

## walls

```
these four walls confine
yet beyond them, i am lost
safety's fragile lie
```
