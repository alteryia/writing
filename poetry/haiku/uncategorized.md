_a haiku collection about uncategorized and general subjects_

## alteryia

```
i made up this name
because it sounded pretty
it's: al-tery-ia
```

## serene cuts

```
edges fine and keen
through silence, it cleaves unseen
sharp, simple, serene
```

## subject

```
framed in golden light
the subject stands, still and proud
frozen in a gaze
```
