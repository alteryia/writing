a haiku collection about uncategorized and general subjects.

## alteryia

```
i made up this name
because it sounded pretty
it's: al-tery-ia
```

## secret

```
whispered silently
kept close, yet always out there
what fades when revealed?
```

## serene cuts

```
edges fine and keen
through silence, it cleaves unseen
sharp, simple, serene
```
