# love

_a haiku collection about love_

## star crossed

```
lonely mismatched pairs
each searching for the other
star crossed wanderers
```

## first love

```
hearts beat soft and fast
nervous smiles, stolen glances
youthful hearts collide
```

## sparks

```
syncopated sparks
electric touch, i'm reeling
caught in your orbit
```

## gaze

```
there's a certain thrill
in your eyes, i find my high
drowning in your gaze
```

## desire

```
silent chasing hearts
dreams sparked by secret glances
electric desire

eyes lock, flames arise
magnetic pull draws us close
hearts race, worlds align
```

## simple

```
in your arms, i find
simple love with golden highs
forever starts here
```

## friendship

```
side by side we stand
through laughter, tears, and silence
together we rise

bright eyes, bursting bright
moments shared in careless cheer
hearts as light as air
```

## choice

```
a hand held in trust
the right choice feels soft, steady
heart's compass at rest
```

## vow

```
two souls intertwined
promises beneath the sky
lifetimes in one vow
```

## timelessly

```
symphony of hues
twin spirits dance, unbroken
witness to the end
```

## paths

```
hearts beat out of sync
side by side, yet apart still
paths diverge in time
```

## fading

```
moments lost in haze
fading flames and ashen love
dreams sail out of sight
```

## wither

```
words left unspoken
we watch this love slowly die
withering away
```

## conflict

```
unending fires
clashing hearts, a fierce tempest
love's storm rages on
```

## deceit

```
whispers of deceit
plans shatter in the spotlight
trust crumbles to dust
```

## betrayal

```
dusty promises
behind the mask, a dagger
trust fractures in pain
```

## heartbreak

```
a heart once so full
splintered by unspoken words
time grieves in stillness
```

## pretend

```
pure inked emotions
pretending the pain away
of a love withdrawn
```

## loss

```
love that flew away
echoes of what could have been
finding peace in loss
```

## end

```
as we watch the flames
bystanders to our own love
silent as we fall
```

## small talk

```
connections revived
small talk drifts like autumn leaves
fleeting, yet it clings
```

## the one that got away

```
fleeting summer dream
promises whispered, now lost
memories fade slow
```

## longing

```
chasing fading lights
lost in what we can't reclaim
a bittersweet sigh
```

## repair

```
handy with tools, he
fixes all but his own heart
love's repairs remain

handy with tools, she
fixes all but her own heart
love's repairs remain
```

## heal

```
tender scars remain
time gently mends fractured hearts
hope blooms once again

step forward, release
burdens lift with each new dawn
new horizons call
```
