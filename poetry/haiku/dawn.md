# dawn

_a haiku collection about dawn, mornings, and more_

## birds chirping

```
i sing in the light
my melody fills the air
the day has begun
```

## breakfast

```
crispy buttered toasts
bacon, eggs, and cheese sizzle
a delightful feast
```

## breeze

```
cool morning breeze stirs
carrying dawn's gentle touch
awakening life
```

## cloud

```
drifting wingless flight
transforming shapes in the sky
gentle cotton dreams
```

## curtains

```
curtains drawn aside
light spills in with quiet grace
golden amber room
```

## daybreak

```
i chase away night
painting skies with amber hues
heralding the day
```

## daylight

```
at dawn's quiet breath
soft light spills, honeyed rooftops
gentle golden rays
```

## dew

```
dew on morning grass
petals drenched in sunlight's glow
the world wakes in haze
```

## dreams

```
an uncharted dream
fragile yet fiercely alive
tomorrow awaits
```

## first sip

```
first light meets my cup
tea, coffee, or something else?
closed eyes, choice is made

rising swirling steam
gentle cozy warmth fills me
comfort in each sip
```

## forecast

```
checking the sky's mood
sun or clouds, the choice is set
ready for the day
```

## jog / walk

```
the path calls me forth
early light on empty streets
pace slow, mind at ease
```

## petrichor

```
air that wakes the soul
morning dew and petrichor
breathe in, start the day
```

## stretch

```
arm reach for the sky
body wakes with every stretch
peace fills the still room
```

## stillness

```
silent serene hush
a pause before the rush comes
peace in the stillness
```

## sunrise

```
rising from the dark
unveiling the world in light
melting the night's frost
```

## to-do list

```
planning for the day
i make endless to-do lists
time to start the day
```

## traffic

```
humming distant cars
of early morning traffic
roads fill with motion
```

## waking up

```
morning breathes softly
sleep's haze lifts with each heartbeat
the world calls me forth
```
