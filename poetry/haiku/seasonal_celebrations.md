# seasonal celebrations

a haiku collection about seasonal and yearly celebrations

## new year's day

```
champagne rivers flow
resolutions? maybe so
sigh, the gym awaits
```

## valentine's day

```
cupid shot his bow
fated unexpected sparks
hearts and flowers bloom
```

## groundhog day

```
the groundhog peeks out
spring determined by shadows
will warmth soon arrive?
```

## president's day

```
flags wave in the breeze
reflecting on those who led
legacies remain
```

## spring day

```
morning dew glistens
buds awaken, stretch in light
new nature whispers

sunset skies shimmer
singing spring's sweet serenade
soft scents soothe the soul
```

## easter

```
hidden coloured eggs
i found one, but ate the prize
chocolate delight
```

## earth day

```
planted a seedling
forgot to water it, oops
oh well, "nature's way"
```

## summer slumber

```
light clothes in summer
sweat stains are quite the bummer
shaded bliss slumber
```

## sunburns and seagulls

```
sunburn on my back
lost my hat in ocean waves
seagull takes my snack!
```

## independence day (USA)

```
sparkling dancing skies
celebrating our freedom
summer's here tonight
```

## drenched summer days

```
splish, splash, what a blast
water balloon explosions
drenched summer days
```

## labor day

```
grill smoke in the air
friends and family gather
to honour hard work
```

## crimson forests

```
autumn leaves signal
crimson forests flare, then fade
withering cold life
```

## autumn

```
wrapped in amber scarves
fragments of colour collide
crisp leaves dancing by
```

## pumpkins

```
orange orbs aglow
crisp autumn chill sweeps the fields
vibrant sunset hue
```

## trick or treat

```
ghosts and goblins cheer
chocolate's the ultimateâ€”
HEY! what's this, a trick?
```

## thanksgiving

```
gravy rivers flow
pumpkin pie's a dessert dash
dinner rolls, bread fight

family feuds spark
satisfied by post feast peace
thankful for the food
```

## snowflakes

```
winter's icy breath
dancing swirling pure snowflakes
```

## frozen branches creak

```
flush of crimson cheeks
warmth rises with tender thoughts
winter air feels soft
```

## christmas

```
tangled lights again
santa's sleigh needs a repair
who ate all the snacks?
```
