# aquatic

_a haiku collection about aquatic environments and bodies of water_

## coves

```
hiding in the cliffs
of sheltered tranquil waters
a quiet refuge

secluded waters
rock walls guard the soft shoreline
serene peaceful tides
```

## gentle tides

```
stillness reigns supreme
gentle tides weave timeless songs
night's calm symphony
```

## glaciers

```
i move slow and vast
carving mountains with my touch
frozen but alive

ancient ice whispers
cracking, shifting through the years
silent, cold and vast

frozen rivers glide
beneath the weight of time's hand
glaciers carve the world
```

## gleaming waves

```
softly gleaming waves
glittering arcs crest and fall
quiet glowing grace
```

## lakes

```
i rest in the hills
mirror the sky with stillness
yet never reach sea

still waters reflect
the sky's changing hues at dusk
peace within the depths

lakes hold ancient tales
ripples dance on silent shores
secrets beneath waves
```

## lanterns

```
softly swirling lights
lunar glow enchants the sea
stars hum in reply

floating lights at dusk
shimmer on the still, dark lake
guiding spirits home
```

## liquid silver

```
humming ancient winds
liquid silver sways with grace
time slips into sleep
```

## misty lakes

```
mist curls on still lakes
reflections paint night's canvas
soft ripples dissolve

morning fog rises
dimming the world with cool breath
lake hides in the haze
```

## oceans

```
endless shifting blue
breathing without a heartbeat
holding the world's weight

deep currents below
carrying tales of old worlds
echoing in waves

foam kisses the shore
tides return what they've borrowed
shifting salted air
```

## pirate treasure

```
swaying seaweed shrouds
a hidden pirate treasure
midnight heist by thieves
```

## puddles

```
puddle grips the earth
anchor for wandering rain
stillness holds the storm
```

## reefs

```
blooming beneath waves
alive with colours and life
walls guarding the deep

fish dart through the blue
hidden in coral caverns
fragile, yet steadfast
```

## rhythmic shore

```
painting quiet tunes
foam-lined edges kiss the shore
soft rhythms remain
```

## rivers

```
carving through the earth
my path is endless and swift
i meet the sea's call

winding through the trees
dancing with the soft moonlight
nature's tear streaked face
```

## seaweed

```
seaweed ribbons dance
aquatic emerald waltz
sea's silent grace
```

## silver tides

```
dancing moonlit waves
silver tides embrace the shore
stars watch, ever still
```

## swamps

```
i dwell in the mist
my waters teeming with life
mud and reeds entwined
```

## tranquil waters

```
sharp edge meets the flow
water trickles soft and slow
nature's calm tableau
```

## waterfalls

```
leaping from great heights
rushing, tumbling, with great force
roaring as i fall
```
