# hypocrite anthem

```
i'm a hypocrite in a candy-coated disguise
speaking truth, but i'm living the lies
i make a stand, but i'm too scared to fall
i'm all talk, no walk, after all

i say i'll fight for what's right
but my hands are empty every night
i'll take the high road, i'll take the blame
but then i'm quick to turn around and play the game

i'm the rebel who still follows the trends
a walking paradox, it never ends
oh, i light the fire, then blame the smoke
my actions are a never-ending joke

pointin' fingers with my dirty hands
buildin' castles in the sinking sand
say one thing, then do another
hiding from the truth, i'm undercover

hate the fake, but i fake it too
call it out, then follow through
throwing stones from a castle of glass
actin' clean with a messy past

oh, i play the hero in a crooked tale
tear the system down, then set up the sale
i'm the villain in my own redemption arc
trying to heal, but i'm tearing it apart

said i'll leave, but i'm still here
stuck in the chaos i pretend to fear
i'm the critic of my favorite sins
a losing battle that i always win

i tell you i'm changing, but i'm staying the same
chasing validation, all for the fame
i'll post the quote, i'll write the song
but when i'm alone, i know i'm wrong

said i hate the noise, but i turn it up loud
preachin' silence, screamin' in a crowd
yelling "save the planet" with my plastic cup
yeah, i know, i know, i'm messed up

i'm the vibe i claim to hate most
repost the wisdom, but ignore the post
i ghost your texts, and call it "space"
but when you don't reply, i lose my grace

hypocrite anthem, turn it up loud
say one thing, but i throw it all out
judge you hard, but i'm worse inside
a clich√© that i cannot hide

i tell you that i'm different, yeah, i'll swear i'll grow
but the mirror says i'm stuck, and i already know
i'm the mess i swore i'd never be
a hypocritical unapologetic me

mirror, mirror, tell me why
i'm the truth wrapped up in a lie
chasing shadows, i watch them grow
can't escape what i already know

mirror, mirror, we're both to blame
but i'll still play the same old game
hiding the truth, can't you see?
the real problem looks like me

i try to be the person that i'm not
chasing all the ideals that i forgot
but deep down, i can feel it burn
maybe it's time for me to learn

hypocrite anthem, sing it with me
we're all pretending, can't you see?
point the finger, then turn it around
a fool wearing a hypocrite crown

yeah i'm a mess, i'll admit it now
still gonna act like i've figured it out
pretend i'm perfect, even when i fall
i'm a hypocrite after all
