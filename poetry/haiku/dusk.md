# dusk

_a haiku collection about dusk and nocturnal events_

## canvas of dreams

```
cosmic sea canvas
lulled by the witching hour peace
dreams drift, worries fade
```

## comedian's hour

```
late night talk show hosts
wit and charm in every line
laughter ease harsh truths
```

## crimson sun

```
crimson sun descends
fields blaze in fiery red
night whispers in dread
```

## daylight's retreat

```
remnants of daylight
retreating into shadows
darkness descending
```

## dimmed brilliance

```
lost in dark corners
glitter hides, once bright and bold
faded dusty glow
```

## galaxies

```
vast worlds beckon forth
stars flicker in endless night
galaxies collide
```

## hazy moon

```
hazy moonlit sky
crimson edges, bashful glow
night's serene gift

hazy moonbeams glow
softly blurring night's sharp edge
mysteries unfold

hazy moon above
veiled in night's soft, whispered sighs
dreams float, silken skies
```

## heist

```
silent steps converge
vault cracks open, silent cheer
gold departs, unseen

shadows grip the night
silent footsteps near the vault
gone before the dawn
```

## insomnia

```
insomnia strikes
tossing, turning, counting sheep
still here wide awake
```

## lonesome twilight

```
a lonesome twilight
whispers carried on the breeze
night sighs in silence
```

## midnight drives

```
headlights slice the dark
coffee cups and midnight talks
starlit hearts entwine
```

## nocturnal

```
moonlit painted trees
unseen world in darkened skies
creatures awaken
```

## reflection

```
moonlight's gentle kiss
ripples shimmer in soft light
invite reflection
```

## secrets

```
secrets wrapped in mist
shadows keep their silent tales
mysteries remain

whispers in the dark
silent truths lie in wait, veiled
secrets softly fade
```

## stars

```
shadows cast their reign
flickers in the depths of night
wish upon a star
```

## tranquility

```
soft piano songs
reading stories as it rains
insomnia cure
```

## weary skies

```
darkness claims the depths
velvet dusk wraps weary skies
eternity waits
```

## wormhole

```
lost in space, it's dark
through a wormhole, i embark
oops, met a space shark!
```
