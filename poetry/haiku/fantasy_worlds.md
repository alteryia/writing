# fantasy worlds

a haiku collection set in a fantasy world

## fate

```
in the end, we're bound
to the timeless pull of fate
unforeseen forces
```

## the alchemical culinarian

potion and spice blend
alchemy in every dish
flavours shape the soul
```

amethyst scales gleam
storms surge, clouds swirl, drake takes flight
stars tremble and fall
```

```
arcane currents clash
power flows where realms converge
the nexus ignites
```

bound by astral flames
forged beneath moon's silver glow
slicing through the void
```

wails of endless grief
sorrow weaves her spectral crown
death bends to the queen
```

shards of gleaming light
spells cascade like falling stars
her will shapes the world
```

```
through the crystal crypt
ghostly echoes fill the air
souls trapped in still light

ember wrought chanting
boundless song through timeless skies
eternity's flame
```

## the eldritch throne

cracked stone, lost ruler
endless night for centuries
madness fills the void
```

## the ember crown prophecy

```
cloaked in crimson flames
ashen haired, scarlet eyed child
ember crown's return
```

stars etch sacred lines
grimoire of eternal life
ancients carve their will
```

## the euphoric echo

```
echoes soft, aglow
euphoria's timeless chord
winds weave ancient songs
```

exiled from the dawn
a soul bound by endless grief
vengeance seeks its home
```

## the forgotten spell

```
lost words in the wind
the forgotten spell ignites
chaos stirs once more
```

frozen endless grief
her lament chills mortal hearts
haunting melody
```

## the golem's heart

stone heart beats with might
formed by flames and bound by will
life through iron flows
```

```
fading ashen light
pale and still in starless seas
hollowed moons remain
```

## the ironwood legacy

```
beneath iron leaves
legends grow through twisted bark
strength from ages past
```

## the last runekeeper

```
mystic runes aglow
guardian remains alone
fate rests in their hands
```

## the paladin's paradox

```
sword of light, heart torn
vows of honour clash with fate
duty leaves no peace
```

## the phoenix myst

```
flames rise, shadows fade
embers whisper through the sky
rebirth in the ash
```

## the reaper's heir

```
heir of the reaper
cloaked in fate's heavy burden
bearing duty's blade
```

## the rose citadel

```
petals crown the walls
blooming crimson on pillars
strength within each thorn
```

## the runebound requiem

mystic runes humming
a requiem for lost souls
heralds of death wait
```

## the serenity seeker

```
through still, misted hills
serenity seeker roams
peace blooms in their wake
```

```
war and betrayal
once sacred, now corrupted
tragic shattered vale
```

```
forbidden codex
ancient secrets awaken
silver flamed knowledge
```

## the starborn pact

```
souls drawn by fate's pull
born of starlight, crowned cosmos
eternal vow forged
```

## the twilight labyrinth

```
endless paths await
silent shifting shadows stretch
stars fade in its depths
```

## the timeless covenant

```
pale beneath the moon
covenant in astral glow
timeless oaths endure
```

## the veil of midnight

```
stir the shadowed skies
eons speak through starlit veils
heavens cast their gaze
```

## the wandering wordsmith

```
quill and blade in hand
stories shared throughout the realm
legends never fade
```

## the wild sorceress

```
swirling veils of mist
spellwoven pulsating earth
wilds bend to her will
```
