# everyday moments

_a haiku collection about everyday moments_

## ambitions at rest

```
my laziness gets
the better of me sometimes
too comfy for goals
```

## caffeine

```
caffeine highs and lows
rising waves of restless thoughts
afternoon mood swings
```

## grocery lines

```
endless rows of goods
lost in thought of what to cook
patience in the queue
```

## laundry day again

```
overflowing clothes
how did i wear all of this
in just a few days
```

## sunlight shower

```
eyes closed, mindfulness
shower in summer sunlight
bask in golden hues
```

## soapy renewal

```
kitchen sink dishes
pounded by soapy water
clean and bright it shines
```

## tapestry threads

```
a single thread pulls
tangled in forgotten knots
memory in threads

through needle and cloth
a story lines each stitch made
tension in each pass

squares of patched colours
edges frayed, stitched together
fabric of the past

trace the seams and folds
old patterns speak of warmth past
quilt of moments worn

canvas of the past
patterns merge in entwined thought
tapestry of life
```
