# city life

a haiku collection about city life

## a city life

```
traffic lights flicker
strangers pass in hurried strides
sirens wail and fade
```

## convenience

```
late night stores aglow
satisfy midnight cravings
snacks for restless souls
```

## crosswalk

```
white lines, lights flicker
crowds momentarily pause
rush begins again
```

## crowd

```
a sea of strangers
endless waves of fleeting steps
shuffling swiftly

busy streets pulse on
voices blend in the chaos
lost in life's current
```

## cyclists

```
swiftly through still streets
riders weave through morning haze
city awakens
```

## diversity

```
diversity thrives
cultures dance and intertwine
evolve together
```

## graffiti

```
ink drips, tags remain
a canvas of the unheard
stories left behind
```

## hidden

```
in hidden corners
a quiet world softly breathes
away from the rush
```

## lights

```
watchers of the void
a canvas of city lights
constellations fade
```

## morning rush

```
coffee spills, missed trains
everyone's late, but it's fine
we're all in this mess
```

## neon city

```
neon signs pulse bright
rain soaked streets reflect the lights
urban pulse in sync
```

## phone booths

```
dusty phone booths stand
faded buttons of the past
time's relics linger
```

## sirens

```
wailing through the night
echoes of a restless world
streets pulse with distress
```

## skyline

```
neon lights flicker
steel peaks piercing the twilight
city etched at dusk
```

## skyscrapers

```
clouds kiss every peak
glass and steel reflect the sky
night falls, lights aglow
```

## spilled coffee

```
rushing through the crowd
spilled coffee on my shirt, but
at least i'm on time
```

## street vendors

```
sizzling by the street
distinct flavours mixed with joy
a feast on the go
```

## subway

```
veins of the city
tracks stretch through the unseen depths
steel carries us home
```

## tourists

```
dreamy eyed tourists
captivated by the glow
new worlds to explore
```

## traffic

```
cars crawl down the streets
flashes of red and yellow
tirelessly still
```

## urban parks

```
take a nature break
green spaces breathe, calm and wide
in the heart of stone
```
