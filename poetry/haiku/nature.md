# nature

_a haiku collection about nature_

## azure sky

```
azure sky, clear and vast
sharp light cuts through, shadows cast
trickle of time, passed
```

## blossoms

```
bright bursting blossoms
bedecked in brilliant bouquets
blooming blissfully
```

## bounty

```
blue bonnet bounty
beneath the boughs, beauty breathes
basking butterflies
```

## branches

```
bold brushstroke breezes
ballet of branches bending
blooming beneath beams
```

## carnations

```
capture the calm of
crimson, coral, carnations
colour cascades charm
```

## daffodils

```
green leaves hug the earth
yellow petals in the breeze
spring grants them rebirth
```

## dandelions

```
yellow burst of cheer
dancing in the springtime breeze
wishes floating near
```

## faraway

```
faraway forests
fields of fragrance freely flow
fleeting fancies fall
```

## flora

```
flourishing flora
ferns and flowers fiercely fight
forest finds its form
```

## fragmented flora

```
fragmented flora
forgotten foliage fields
fading in the fog
```

## fresh wind

```
whispering fresh wind
stirring leaves, awakening
life's breath, unseen, felt

fresh wind, morning's sigh
rustling the sleepy trees' dreams
day's magical breath

fresh wind whispers through
stirring leaves, souls alike
new journeys take flight

fresh wind dances by
whispering through emerald leaves
nature's breath, revived
```

## glade

```
through towering trees
a clearing in the woods waits
with emerald grass

branches stretch above
a soft glow fills the open
footsteps fade away
```

## hydrangeas

```
blue, pink, purple hues
lush blooms fill the garden scene
summer's vivid crown
```

## lavender

```
calm violet waves
aromatic dreams arise
serenity shared
```

## mineral

```
minerals fracture
earth's shattering sighs capture
beauty in rapture

rocks whisper their tales
in minerals, beauty veils
nature's story sails

beneath mountain's gaze
minerals etch time's long phase
earth's hidden treasure

veins of the deep earth
mineral forms, silent birth
nature's hidden worth
```

## morning dew

```
morning dew slides down
leaf to leaf, to ground it goes
silently trickling
```

## orchids

```
dreams of elegance
veins of gold trace vibrant hues
soft beauty prevails
```

## petals

```
lush petals swaying
drifting fragrance in the air
gentle breezes sigh
```

## roses

```
thorns grip the petals
crimson bursts in summer heat
beauty with a bite

a single rose fades
edges curl, color wanes thin
time claims all things bright
```

## sakura

```
swirling pink petals
soft breath of the azure sky
fleeting beauty reigns
```

## sunflowers

```
bending toward the dawn
golden blooms reach toward the sky
nodding in still fields

sparrows sing sweetly
soft scents swirl, stems stretch skyward
sunflowers swaying
```

## seeds

```
seeds kiss the earth's bed
under the sun's gentle gaze
nature's serene bloom
```

## wisteria

```
wisteria vines
cascade of lavender hues
springtime's sweet perfume

softly kissed by spring
veils of violet grace the breeze
dreams of purple skies
```
