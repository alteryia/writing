# fading seasons

_a haiku collection about fading seasons_

## spring sorrow

```
blossoms softly fall
petals whispering goodbyes
silent spring sorrows
```

## summer melancholia

```
burning golden light
a longing drifts on warm winds
summer reverie
```

## autumn gloom

```
cold winds twist and moan
grey skies weep for fading light
autumn swept away
```

## winter blues

```
from numb snowy hearts
frozen depths of winter's edge
warmth long forgotten
```
