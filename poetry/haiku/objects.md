# objects

_a haiku collection about objects_

## bubble wrap

```
tiny pops of joy
fingers across bubbly sheets
stress fades with each burst

underneath plastic
tons of little bubbles wait
soft and playful snaps
```

## compass

```
compass spins around
seeking north in shifting winds
lost, but moving still
```

## paperclip

```
silver loops connect
binding papers together
order in chaos
```
