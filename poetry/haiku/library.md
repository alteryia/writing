_a haiku collection about books, writing, and more_

## autosave

```
finally finished
my masterpiece manuscript
where was autosave?
```

## bibliophile

```
stacks of fading texts
ink-stained lore and stories call
thirst for words unquenched

ink flows ever on
tales waiting on distant shelves
books never run dry
```

## bibliosmia

```
stroll through dusk-lit halls
blended scents of books and time
ink-stained reverie

leather-bound covers
their fragrance wraps around me
time drips from each page
```

## books

```
infinite journeys
bound in leaves of thought and dream
books hold worlds unseen
```

## bookmarks

```
bookmarks keep my place
notes scribbled in the margins
thoughts linger through time
```

## bookshelf

```
books stacked high and bold
stories beckon, minds explore
a world yet to know
```

## bookstore

```
knowledge wait in rows
wisdom bound in every text
universes await
```

## codex

```
ancient scrolls reveal
knowledge etched in fragile lines
time's secrets preserved
```

## discovery

```
new name on the shelf
excitement stirs as i read
binging all their works
```

## library

```
lost in endless tomes
curled in corners, stories bloom
oh, it's closing time?
```

## lost

```
lost in printed worlds
where ancient voices linger
reality fades
```

## manuscript

```
ink upon parchment
seals of wisdom bound in time
pages wear the past
```

## parchment

```
ancient, worn, it rests
tales of yore in veins concealed
dust of ages stir
```

## poems

```
verses carve the mind
spilled inked secrets of the soul
timeless thoughts entwined
```

## procrastination

```
work stacked to the sky
thick plots whisper "just one more"
procrastination
```

## quill

```
feathers dipped in ink
ancient scripts on parchment bare
history preserved
```

## soul script

```
soul script, parchment hearts
fingers tremble, ink spills truth
scars carved by secrets
```

## tales

```
pages whisper tales
lives unfold in silent words
ink blooms, story sails
```

## the last page

```
the last page is here
story ends, but i remain
reluctant goodbye
```

## tome

```
wisdom sealed in dust
ashen glyphs of lore endure
time's voice held captive

tomes of ancient lore
heavy with truth, burden, and
the weight of wisdom
```

## unread

```
stacks of unread stories
i swear i'll read them someday
oops, i bought more books
```

## words

```
ignited stories
words weaved by restless hands
a world born from ink
```

## writing

```
inked emotions spill
thoughts entwined in vivid hues
canvas of the mind
```
