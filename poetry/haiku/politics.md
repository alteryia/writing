# politics

_a haiku collection about politics_

## activism

```
working together
organize and volunteer
hearts unite for good

crowds gather, hearts full
chants echo for what we need
and calling for change

bold signs help up high
protest, petition, rally
fight for what is right
```

## advertisements

```
ads flash on the screen
promises in every word
who can we believe?
```

## corruption

```
behind closed doors are
scandals that could shake the world
justice lies in wait

vote for those who are
unclouded by corruption
let's banish the rot
```

## debates

```
arguments unfold
facts and figures take their turn
who will sway the crowd?

words fly, sharp and strong
yet bridges form through the noise
unity takes root
```

## democracy vs dictatorship

```
freedom fights for light
control seeks to quench the flame
hearts beat for change
```

## diplomacy / alliances

```
across distant lands
ink on paper seals the ties
alliances grow

in times of distress
we come to their aid with strength
unity prevails
```

## economy

```
markets rise and fall
wealth shifts in the balance beam
uncertainty grows

pockets overflow
while hunger lines the streets
wealth divides the world
```

## environmental protection

```
earth cries out for care
polluted skies, toxic lands
protect what remains

rising tides, and heat
ice melts, oceans swell with trash
action lags behind
```

## fact check

```
facts are bent, shaped, spun
narratives for power's sake
truth fades in the haze

don't assume, confirm
is it true or fictional?
trust in proven facts
```

## fraud

```
friend or fraud, who's who?
deception's game, now in view
caught in lies, adieu
```

## gun reform

```
guns in restless hands
a call for safety grows loud
action must be done
```

## immigration

```
crossing distant lands
seeking refuge, hopes anew
a new life begins
```

## halls of power

```
voices rise and fade
echoes in halls of power
change blooms, silent hope
```

## headlines

```
polls rise, trends shift fast
minds change with each new moment
public thoughts take form

headlines change with time
shifting views paint the landscape
opinions evolve

swiping down the feed
we scroll through the latest news
ever-changing world
```

## peace

```
in fields of gold, stand
resilient hearts, for peace
hope blooms, undeterred
```

## taxes

```
forms spread on the desk
a percentage of my life
government takes note
```

## town hall meetings

```
chatter fills the room
questions rise, discussions made
change begins to stir
```

## trade wars

```
trade wars, sugar high
tariffs bitter, prices soar
sweet treats, now a sigh
```

## vote

```
pen in hand, i mark
cast my voice for the future
democracy speaks
```

## war

```
battles rage afar
leaders weigh the cost of war
peace hangs by a thread

smoke rises, earth shakes
soldiers march through dust and pain
hope fades with each step

crimson dawn breaks forth
echoes of battles long past
silence mourns the lost
```
