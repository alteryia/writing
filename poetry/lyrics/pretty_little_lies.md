# pretty little lies

```
i paint my truth in pastel shades
swipe it on like a tiktok phase
lip glossed words, they glitter and gleam
sell you the dream, but it's not what it seems

oh! i'm the villain in a thrifted coat
spillin' secrets that i never wrote
ghost in the group chat, left on read
got so many thoughts left unsaid

pretty little lies wrapped in vintage lace
i keep 'em in my pocket, every empty phrase
break your heart, and i'm just fine
i'm a gen-z tragedy, wasting your time

i learned my lines from midnight scrolls
faking love is my favourite role
filter my face, filter my soul
a hologram heart you'll never hold

i'm the playlist you'll skip but can't delete
catching feelings in a lo-fi beat
a carousel spinning out of sync
chasing truth at the edge of a drink

and maybe i don't even know who i am
caught between the screen and the scam
every like, every post, every trend
can't be real, it's just pretend

so here's my truth, stitched in a song
i'll wear it loud, but not for long
pretty little lies, they're my disguise
a gen-z tragedy, in your eyes
```
