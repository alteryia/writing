_a haiku collection about animals_

## 🦙 alpaca

```
verdant pasture fields
whimsical wooly wonder
soft serene delight

fluffy heads held high
gentle grazing alpacas
curious calm cute
```

## 🦇 bat

```
wings spread in the dusk
silent flight beneath the stars
nighttime acrobat

hanging upside down
tiny wings, soft fur and ears
dreams in moonlit skies
```

## 🦋 butterfly

```
wings of painted skies
fluttering with gentle grace
delicate, fleeting

in a flower's bloom
butterfly lands, soft and bright
a quiet hello
```

## 😸 cat 🐈

```
quick, while the cat naps
sneak the snacks from the top shelf
caught with crumbs in hand

whiskers twitching fast
laser dot is now the foe
victory! nap time

cat dozes, content
clouds drifting lazily by
with grey misty dreams
```

## 🐮 cow 🐄

```
munching cows, so grand
dining in vibrant pastures
bellies round and full

soft eyes gaze afar
gentle moo fills morning air
hooves tap a slow beat
```

## 🐶 dog 🐕

```
paws chasing their tails
woofs echo, laughter erupts
joy in every leap

fluffy tails a blur
sunlight dances on soft fur
bounds of pure delight
```

## 🐬 dolphin

```
graceful arcs of joy
quick minds dance through azure trails
deep calls pierce the sea

moonlit reflections
dolphins leap through liquid skies
ocean's ballet stars

dolphins leap with joy
spray misting in morning light
oceans hum their song
```

## firefly

```
flickers in the dark
bright spots that move with no sound
small sparks in the air

lights in the still night
darting through the summer haze
chasing fleeting warmth
```

## 🦔 hedgehog

```
tiny paws shuffle
through the autumn leaves with care
hedgehog's quiet roam

cuddled in soft embrace
spines shielded from world's cold touch
tiny paws at rest
```

## 🐴 horse 🐎

```
quick thunderous hooves
strength and spirit intertwine
freedom in each stride

manes free in the wind
mountains echo their journey
riders of the dawn
```

## 🦁 lion

```
golden mane aglow
roars echo through the still air
king of all he sees

playful cubs at play
underneath the watchful eyes
the lioness purrs
```

## 🐵 monkey 🐒

```
swinging through the trees
mischief in a playful grin
jungle's acrobat

leaping from branches
sunlight dances on their fur
freedom in each jump
```

## 🦦 otter

```
playful rivers glide
sleek forms dive with agile grace
crafty paws, sharp minds

currents carry dreams
whiskers twitch beneath the waves
swift as shadows move
```

## 🦉 owl

```
eyes wide in the night
silent wings through moonlit trees
wisdom takes its flight

perched on branches high
feathers ruffle in the breeze
owl watches the sky
```

## 🐼 panda

```
leafy forests sway
pandas roll in playful glee
wrapped in bamboo dreams

sunset's golden hue
slow steps through the quiet glen
paws in soft earth sink
```

## 🦜 parrot

```
feathers bright as gems
chattering tales in the sun
colours in the breeze

perched with playful eyes
repeating words with a wink
cheeky songs take flight
```

## 🐰 rabbit 🐇

```
soft fur and bright eyes
hopping through the sunny fields
nibbling on fresh greens

ears perk up, alert
gentle paws in rhythmic steps
dancing through the grass
```

## 🦝 raccoon

```
tiny paws at work
searching through the midnight trash
mischief in their eyes

masked face in moonlight
sneaky paws make quiet tracks
nighttime thief at play
```

## 🦭 seal

```
rippling azure waves
sleek seals lounge on rocky shores
basking in the sun

resting on cool rocks
gentle waves lap at their sides
sunlight warms their coats
```

## 🐿️ squirrel

```
bushy tail flicks high
curious flickering eyes
squirrels scamper through

plum drops, thief in sight
squirrel steals with nimble might
fruit ninja takes flight

swift paws, a quick dash
plum in tow, a flash of fur
prize is safely stashed
```

## 🦢 swan

```
grace on still waters
feathers glisten in the sun
gliding without care

elegant and white
a swan lifts its head and calls
peace upon the lake
```

## 🐯 tiger 🐅

```
through the jungle's hum
quiet paws tread on soft earth
waiting, watching still

stripes of black and gold
sneaky tiger hunts its prey
ROAR! scared you away!
```

## 🐢 turtle

```
slow and steady pace
shell tucked safe in peaceful calm
wandering the shore

tiny steps on sand
a little head peeks out first
home in every shell
```

## 🦄 unicorn

```
hooves sparkle like stars
a rainbow trails in the mist
dreams on gentle wings

with a horn of light
trotting through the forest glade
magic in each step
```

## 🐺 wolf

```
through the silent pines
a lone wolf stalks, eyes aglow
wild, untamed, and free

in the forest deep
a lone wolf howls to the sky
autumn wind replies

moonlit shadows roam
piercing howls, midnight echoes
fierce hearts run as one
```

## 🦓 zebra

```
monochrome stripes swirl
hooves echo across the plains
grace in every step

together they roam
painting patterns in the grass
nature's art alive
```
