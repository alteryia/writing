_a haiku collection about games_

## astroneer

```
under alien skies
we dig through dust and silence
new worlds wait below

strong tough rocks give way
strange landscapes twist and ripple
explorers at heart
```

## dinkum

```
sun soaked terrains call
craft, build, and thrive in the wild
life in the outback
```

## endgame

```
kingdoms rise or fall
fated beneath my command
endgame conqueror
```

## endless sky

```
endless skies above
stars flicker in vast expanse
journeys never cease

cargo ships take flight
across stars, trade winds hum soft
hauling dreams through space

dark voids pulse with dread
space pirates chase through the night
laser beams take aim
```

## experience

```
xp fills the bar
a new skill ignites within
endgame comes at last
```

## ffxiv

```
echoes of the past
in eorzea we stand
adventure awaits

chocobos take flight
through vast lands, our bonds are strong
friends in every storm
```

## game on!

```
ready, set, game on!
chaotic antics ensue
respawn! never quit!
```

## jenga

```
wood blocks stack and lean
each move a fragile whisper
extremely tense match

tower sways, unsure
hands steady, hearts race with fear
will it stand or fall?

twenty stories high
jenga tower built so grand
oops, tumbled, unplanned
```

## just dance

```
lights flash, music calls
feet moving to the rhythm
we dance without fear

arms sway, hearts beat fast
a colorful blur of fun
we move as one now

shuffle dance attempt
tripped on my own two left feet
laughing on the floor
```

## league of legends

```
champions collide
runes cast in the twilight sky
victory awaits

lanes stretch, minds at war
minions march and turrets fall
a nexus awaits
```

## mahjong

```
clicking bamboo tiles
grand strategies, skill, and wit
mastermind at play

matches, sequences
ancient patterns shift around
victory in sight
```

## minecraft

```
block by block we build
forever on peaceful mode
no fear of the night

stacking blocks day and night
mining deep in caverns wide
trusty pickaxe swings
```

## my time at portia

```
mysterious ruins
tools and skills sharpened with care
portia's heart beats strong

workshops hum with life
gather, craft, build dreams anew
the town grows each day

in portia's bright streets
forging friendships and romance
life begins to bloom
```

## new world: aeternum

```
untouched land calls loud
eternal life promises
warriors take hold

ancient lands await
fortunes forged through strife and strength
fates entwined through time
```

## no man's sky

```
infinite cosmos
planets rich with life and lore
exploration calls

stars light the vast space
winds guide my ship through the void
adventure awaits
```

## no rush

```
endless worlds to roam
play as you want, there's no rush
the adventure calls
```

## sid meier's civilization

```
dreamlike empires
diplomacy versus war
legacies survive

rivers carve the land
nations rise and fall in time
empires stretch far

science? religion?
cultures clash on global stage
strategy unfolds
```

## stacklands

```
stacks of shifting fates
coins, combat, and crafted trades
life balanced on cards

humble beginnings
a thriving town grows each day
progress in each stack
```

## tetris

```
vibrant squares align
of pixelated rainbows
perfectly placed clears

shapes fall from above
twisting, turning into place
lines clear, space expands

blocks descend in rows
a puzzle that never ends
focus and flow rise
```

## the sims

```
simulated lives
humble homes, fancy castles
fates in your control
```

## stardew valley

```
fields of golden crops
sunrise paints the sky anew
harvest dreams come true

friends gather each year
harvests shared, hearts full of cheer
the valley's pulse beats
```

## the witcher 3

```
geralt on the hunt
monsters loom in shadowed woods
fate and steel collide

sword against the dark
destinies entwined in blood
witcher's oath remains
```

## VR

```
pixelated realms
through digital dimensions
alt reality

reality fades
immersed in wide endless realms
a mind set free soars

virtual voyages call
far beyond what you know to
create your own world
```

## valheim

```
misty forests loom
valhalla's call echoes strong
warriors unite

shadows stretch and fade
axes raised in steady hands
the hunt begins now
```
