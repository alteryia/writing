# art

_a haiku collection about art, projects, and more_

## project

```
scattered notes around
endless tasks and to-do lists
step by step it grows

dreams stack upon dreams
one project inspires more
the cycle persists
```

## serene cuts

```
edges fine and keen
through silence, it cleaves unseen
sharp, simple, serene
```

## subject

```
framed in golden light
the subject stands, still and proud
frozen in a gaze
```
