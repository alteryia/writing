# offline

```
i'm scrolling through the feed like it's all i've got
filling up my head with a life i never sought
everybody's perfect, everybody's fine
but i'm falling apart, trying to keep in line

got a thousand new likes, but it doesn't feel real
faking happiness, but i don't know how to heal
i'm stuck in the loop, but i don't wanna play
wishing i could put my phone away

i'm tired of the screens, tired of the noise
the pressure's getting loud, it's drowning my voice
trying to keep up, but i'm losing the fight
i just wanna be free, i just wanna feel right
can't you see? i need to go offline
this world's too much, i need some space and time

i watch the stories, the lives they portray
and wonder if i'm just wasting my days
the constant updates, the endless scroll
it's eating me up, taking a toll

i see the comments, but they don't stick
chasing validation, but it's never quick
i'm addicted to likes, but it's never enough
filling my soul with distractions that're tough

i'm tired of the screens, tired of the trends
everyone's got something, but it never ends
i thought i'd find peace, but i'm lost in the noise
trapped in this cycle, chasing false joys
can't you see? i need to go offline
break away, and leave it all behind

every post feels like a weight on my chest
i'm searching for meaning in a world that's a mess
the highlight reel's a lie i've been sold
i'm craving something real, something bold

i'm tired of the screens, tired of the fame
caught in the loop, it's always the same
i just want to breathe without the spotlight
to find my peace in the quiet of the night
can't you see? i need to go offline
i'm letting go, i'm taking back what's mine

i'll be back when i'm stronger, when i find my way
but for now, i'm logging out and walking away
no more fake smiles, no more pretending to shine
i'm going offline, and i'll be just fine
```
