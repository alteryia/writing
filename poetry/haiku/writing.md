# writing

_a haiku collection about writing_

## autosave

```
finally finished
my masterpiece manuscript
where was autosave?
```

## contract

```
a steady hand signs
words bind futures yet to come
promises in ink
```

## manuscript

```
ink upon parchment
seals of wisdom bound in time
pages wear the past
```

## poems

```
verses carve the mind
spilled inked secrets of the soul
timeless thoughts entwined
```

## quill

```
feathers dipped in ink
ancient scripts on parchment bare
history preserved
```

## soul script

```
soul script, parchment hearts
fingers tremble, ink spills truth
scars carved by secrets
```

## words

```
ignited stories
words weaved by restless hands
a world born from ink
```

## writing

```
inked emotions spill
thoughts entwined in vivid hues
canvas of the mind
```
