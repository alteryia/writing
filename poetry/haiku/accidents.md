# accidents

_a haiku collection about accidents_

## autocorrect

```
quickly write and send
autocorrect strikes again
boss gets odd message
```

## cosmetic chaos

```
lost in purse's deep pit
lipstick cap takes a nose-dive
cherry red mischief
```

## lost sock

```
one sock's lost its mate
oh well, silly mismatched day
chaos on my feet
```

## silly day

```
sparkles on my head
backwards shoes and socks instead
silly day ahead
```

## slippery

```
slip on seat so sly
bottom meets floor in surprise
comedy ensues
```

## snaccident

```
grab snacks for the film
smoke alarm shouts loud and clear
popcorn disaster!
```

## stumble

```
i trip on a crack
pretend it's part of my dance
no one saw that, phew!
```
