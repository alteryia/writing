# everyday moments

_a haiku collection about everyday moments_

## ambitions at rest

```
my laziness gets
the better of me sometimes
too comfy for goals
```

## autocorrect

```
quickly write and send
autocorrect strikes again
boss gets odd message
```

## bubble wrap

```
tiny pops of joy
fingers across bubbly sheets
stress fades with each burst

underneath plastic
tons of little bubbles wait
soft and playful snaps
```

## caffeine

```
caffeine highs and lows
rising waves of restless thoughts
afternoon mood swings
```

## cosmetic chaos

```
lost in purse's deep pit
lipstick cap takes a nose-dive
cherry red mischief
```

## grocery lines

```
endless rows of goods
lost in thought of what to cook
patience in the queue
```

## lost sock

```
one sock's lost its mate
oh well, silly mismatched day
chaos on my feet
```

## laundry day again

```
overflowing clothes
how did i wear all of this
in just a few days
```

## paperclip

```
silver loops connect
binding papers together
order in chaos
```

## small talk

```
connections revived
small talk drifts like autumn leaves
fleeting, yet it clings
```

## silly day

```
sparkles on my head
backwards shoes and socks instead
silly day ahead
```

## slippery

```
slip on seat so sly
bottom meets floor in surprise
comedy ensues
```

## snaccident

```
grab snacks for the film
smoke alarm shouts loud and clear
popcorn disaster!
```

## stumble

```
i trip on a crack
pretend it's part of my dance
no one saw that, phew!
```

## sunlight shower

```
eyes closed, mindfulness
shower in summer sunlight
bask in golden hues
```

## soapy renewal

```
kitchen sink dishes
pounded by soapy water
clean and bright it shines
```

## tapestry threads

```
a single thread pulls
tangled in forgotten knots
memory in threads

through needle and cloth
a story lines each stitch made
tension in each pass

squares of patched colours
edges frayed, stitched together
fabric of the past

trace the seams and folds
old patterns speak of warmth past
quilt of moments worn

canvas of the past
patterns merge in entwined thought
tapestry of life
```
