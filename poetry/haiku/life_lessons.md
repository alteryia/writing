# life lessons

_a haiku collection about life lessons_

## balance

```
tides rise, then recede
moments of rush, then of rest
balance in the flow
```

## breathe

```
rising flame in me
words spill out, too fast, too loud
breathe, and let it go
```

## courage

```
fear stands in my path
step by step, i move ahead
courage leads the way
```

## fate

```
in the end, we're bound
to the timeless pull of fate
and unseen forces
```

## forgiveness

```
release the burden
forgiveness frees the wounded
peace begins within
```

## gratitude

```
thankful for small things
joy blooms where we least expect
grace in every day
```

## growth / change

```
leaves fall, roots remain
seasons teach the art of change
growth blooms through the years

old forms break apart
new paths carved in changing lands
growth beyond the now
```

## health

```
body, mind, and soul
nurture them as treasured wealth
health is all we need
```

## kindness

```
one kind act echoes
ripples in a silent sea
hearts changed by the flow
```

## life

```
it always happens
to somebody else until
it happens to you
```

## mistakes

```
stumbles mark the path
each fall shapes the road ahead
wisdom grows through pain
```

## path

```
the right path whispers
clear and bright, the stars align
certainty in sight
```

## patience

```
seeds waiting to sprout
trusting rain and sun will come
in time, all things grow
```

## perspective

```
thoughts shape what you see
beliefs colour every step
reality shifts
```

## reaction

```
waves crash on the shore
i choose how to meet the tide
my will, my response
```

## reflection

```
time for reflection
silent appreciation
and contemplation
```

## self-love

```
know your worth, stand tall
you're enough just as you are
love yourself, always
```

## simple joys

```
in quiet moments
simple joys become blessings
happiness is here
```

## storms

```
winds shift, branches bend
each storm teaches roots to grow
stillness follows rain
```

## support

```
surround yourself right
those who lift you when you're low
keep good vibes around

with steady backing
fueling every step ahead
lifting you to win
```
